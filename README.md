# Keystroke Logging (Educational Purposes Only)

**Author: Erramsetti Sai Vignesh**

This script demonstrates basic keystroke logging functionality using the `pynput` library. **Important Note:** Keyloggers pose significant ethical and security risks. This code is provided for educational purposes only to understand their potential dangers. **Never deploy a keylogger on a system without explicit consent.**

**Functionality (Educational Overview):**

1. **Imports:** The script imports the `keyboard` module from the `pynput` library.
2. **`keyPressed` Function:** This function handles key presses.
    - It attempts to convert the pressed key to a character (e.g., 'a', 'b').
    - If successful, it writes the character to a file named "keyfile.txt" in append mode.
    - Errors (special keys) are caught and reported.
3. **Main Execution:**
    - A `Listener` object is created to listen for key presses.
    - The listener is started, triggering the `keyPressed` function on each key press.
    - The script waits for the user to press any key to stop logging (using `input()`).

**Ethical Considerations:**

- **Privacy Violation:** Keyloggers record keystrokes without consent, breaching privacy.
- **Security Risk:** They can steal sensitive information like passwords and credit card numbers.
- **Legal Issues:** Installing a keylogger on someone's computer without their consent might be illegal.

**Educational Alternatives:**

- Explore open-source keyloggers for ethical security research with proper authorization.
- Analyze existing keylogger code to understand their vulnerabilities and detection methods. 
- Learn about secure password management practices and ethical security principles.

**Remember:** Always prioritize user consent, security, and ethics in your code practices.
